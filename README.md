# Claude for Financial Services

Reference agents, skills, and data connectors for the financial-services workflows we see most — investment banking, equity research, private equity, and wealth management.

Everything here is available **two ways from one source**: install it as a [Claude Cowork](https://claude.com/product/cowork) plugin, or deploy it through the [Claude Managed Agents API](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/managed-agents) behind your own workflow engine. Same system prompt, same skills — you choose where it runs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Nothing in this repository constitutes investment, legal, tax, or accounting advice. These agents draft analyst work product — models, memos, research notes, reconciliations — for review by a qualified professional. They do not make investment recommendations, execute transactions, bind risk, post to a ledger, or approve onboarding; every output is staged for human sign-off. You are responsible for verifying outputs and for compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to your firm.

> [!NOTE]
> **Personal fork** — I'm using this primarily to explore the equity research and PE valuation workflows. The agents I'm actively testing are Market Researcher, Earnings Reviewer, and Valuation Reviewer. Notes on what's working (and what isn't) for my use case are in [NOTES.md](./NOTES.md).
>
> **Priority order for my use case:** Earnings Reviewer → Market Researcher → Valuation Reviewer. Haven't touched the IB-side agents (Pitch Agent, Meeting Prep) yet — probably out of scope for what I'm doing.

What's in the repo:

- **[Agents](#agents)** — named, end-to-end workflow agents (Pitch Agent, Market Researcher, GL Reconciler, …). Each ships as a Cowork plugin **and** as a [Claude Managed Agent template](./managed-agent-cookbooks) you deploy via `/v1/agents`.
- **[Vertical plugins](#vertical-plugins)** — the underlying skills, slash commands, and data connectors, bundled by FSI vertical. Install these on their own if you just want `/comps`, `/dcf`, `/earnings` and the connectors without a full agent.

## Agents

Each agent is named for the workflow it runs. They're starting points: install the ones that match your work, then tune the prompts, skills, and connectors to how your firm does it.

Each agent plugin is **self-contained** — it bundles the skills it uses, so installing the agent is all you need.

| Function | Agent | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Coverage & advisory** | **[Pitch Agent](./plugins/agent-plugins/pitch-agent)** | Comps, precedents, LBO → branded pitch deck, end to end |
| | **[Meeting Prep Agent](./plugins/agent-plugins/meeting-prep-agent)** | Briefing pack before every client meeting |
| **Research & modeling** | **[Market Researcher](./plugins/agent-plugins/market-researcher)** | Sector or theme → industry overview, competitive landscape, peer comps, ideas shortlist |
| | **[Earnings Reviewer](./plugins/agent-plugins/earnings-reviewer)** | Earnings call + filings → model update → note draft |
| | **[Model Builder](./plugins/agent-plugins/model-builder)** | DCF, LBO, 3-statement, comps — live in Excel |
| **Fund admin & finance ops** | **[Valuation Reviewer](./plugins/agent-plugins/valuation-re
